\paragraph{Idea:} Nearby points have their ``usual'' euclidian distance. If a pair of points are not within a local neigbourhood, then the distance between these points is a \textbf{graph distance}\footnote{Compute the all pairs shortest path (Dejkstra, A*,  DFS, Floydâ€“Warshall, ...)}. Then run MDS on the resulting distance Matrix.

ISOMAP operates on geodesic distances (like a distance on earths surface/distances on the manifold).
